Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request

<instructions>
The following texts are comments from a user's friends on a social network. 
From these comments from friends, try to guess the user's position in relation to the target. 
For example, if a large portion of friends' comments are against the target, it is very likely that the user is also against the target.
Give a score between 0 and 10 where 0 means it is unlikely that the user is against the target and 10 means it is very likely that the user is in favor of the target, in the format `x/10'.
Write only the score in the format 'x/10'. Do not write anything else.
